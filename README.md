A in-browser distributed message board powered by [NKN](https://nkn.org/).

There's no central server. The messages are exchanged between the users via NKN. The users store the messages they receive, and forward them to other users. This way, the messages are stored in multiple places, and can't be easily censored. There is a limit on how many messages you can store, so the old messages are deleted.
Once you close the tab, the messages are gone from your computer.

It can work in Tor and clearnet. It's anonymous, and doesn't require any registration. No user ID is attached to the messages.

Right now, it's a simple chat room. Come and say hi!
